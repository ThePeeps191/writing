    <h1>Capybara on the loose after zoo truck incident near school</h1>
    <p><i>Reporting by calgary34</i></p>
    <p>Yesterday morning, a capybara was set loose after a truck overturned about a kilometer west of Rocky Mountain Middle School. The capybara was reported to have been heading southeast yesterday evening and could be anywhere now.</p>
    <p>"The capybara may still be somewhere nearby. Students and residents near the school should be on the lookout for the capybara. If you see the capybara, note the location and report it to the city's animal control hotline, 616," said Dr. James Murdoch, director of animal control.</p>
    <p>The truck was taking animals, including the capybara, to the zoo when it overturned on Eastman Drive.</p>
    <p>"I was hired to take the animals to the zoo when a car suddenly came by and smacked the side of the truck and overturned it. I was quite shaken, but I didn't get hurt, luckily. I examined the truck and found all the animals to be fine and still in the truck except for the capybara," said the truck driver.</p>
    <p>Capybaras are the world's largest rodent and look like furry pigs. They have a thick body, no tail, a large, flat snout, and small eyes. Capybaras eat grass and water plants and can be found near swamps, ponds, and rivers. Capybaras can graze next to cattle.</p>
