    <h1>Capybara on the loose after zoo truck incident</h1>
    <p><i>Reporting by calgary34</i></p>
    <p>Yesterday morning, a capybara was set loose after a truck overturned near school grounds. It headed north and could be anywhere now.</p>
    <p>"The capybara may still be somewhere nearby. Students and residents near the school should be on the lookout for the capybara. If you see the capybara, note the location and contact wildlife officers," said wildlife officer James Murdoch.</p>
    <p>The truck was taking animals, including a capybara, to the zoo when it overturned on a local road near the school. The driver was shaken, but not hurt. Only the capybara escaped. None of the animals were hurt.</p>
    <p>"Capybaras are the world's largest rodent and look like furry pigs. They have a thick body, no tail, a large, flat snout, and small eyes. Capybaras eat grass and water plants and can be found near swamps, ponds, and rivers. Keep your eyes peeled as capybaras can graze next to cattle," said Parker Neumann, professor of biology at Rocky Mountain College.</p>
